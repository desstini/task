    <h1> JOLLOF RICE</h1>
    <p> 
        Jollof or jollof rice is a rice dish from West Africa. It is typically made with long-grain rice, tomatoes, onions, spices, vegetables and meat in a single pot, although the ingredients and preparation methods vary across different regions.

    <dl> <h3>ABOUT JOLLOF RICE!</h3></dl>
    <dt>HISTORY/ORIGIN</dt>
    <dd>
        The origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that was ruled by the Wolof or Jolof Empire in  the 14th century, spanning parts of today's Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania, where rice was grown. The dish has its roots in the traditional dish called Thieboudienne, containing rice, fish, shellfish and vegetables.
        <p>Food and agriculture historian James C. McCann proposes that the dish spread with the Mali empire, especially the Djula tradespeople who dispersed widely to the regional commercial and urban  centers, taking with them economic arts of "blacksmiting and small-scale marketing, and rice agronomy" as well as the religion of Islam.</p> 
       <p>Marc Dufumier, an emeritus professor of agronomy, proposes that the dish may have appeared as a consequence of the colonial promotion of intensive peanut cropping in central Senegal for the French oil industry, and where commensurate reduction in the planted area of traditonal millet and sorghum staples was compensated by forced imports of broken rice from Southeast Asia. It may then have spread throughout the region through the historical commercial, cultural and religious channels linking Senegal with Ghana, Nigeria and beyond. </p> 
    </dd>
    <dt>REGIONAL VARIATIONS AND RIVALRY</dt>
    <dd>
        Each West African country has at least one variant form of the dish, with Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Cameroon particularly competitive as to which country makes the best jollof. This is especially prominent
        between Nigeria and Ghana, in a rivalry dubbed the "Jollof Wars". 
    </dd> <br>
    <dt> NIGERIAN PARTY JOLLOF</dt>
    <dd>
        Jollof rice is arguably the most popular dish in Nigeria. It is one Nigerian meal that cuts across every tribe and ethnic group in the country, and among the different ways it may be cooked, "party jollof rice" stands out.
        It is cooked using large local cast iron pots which are placed on top of large chunks of firewood. The smoky heat from the charcoal adds a unique and unforgettable flavour that many people love.

   <h4>PREPARATION</h4>
   <ol>
<li>Blend your tomatoes, red pepper and habaneros in a food processor or blender for about 45&nbsp;seconds, make sure that everything is well blended. </li>
<li>In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on medium-high heat. Once the oil is heated, add the onions you set aside and fry just until they turn golden brown.</li> 
<li>Once the onions turns brown in color, add the tomato paste and fry for 2-3&nbsp;minutes.</li> 
<li>Add the blended tomato mixture (reserve about 1/4&nbsp;cup and set aside) and fry the mixture with the onions and tomato paste for about 30&nbsp;minutes. Make sure you stir consistently to avoid burning the tomato mixture.</li>
<li>After 30&nbsp;minutes, turn the heat down to medium, and add the chicken stock. Mix and add your seasonings (salt, curry powder, thyme,seasoning, and the Knorr stock cube). Continue to boil for 10&nbsp;minutes.</li>
<li>Add the parboiled rice to the pot. Mix it very well with the tomato stew. At this point if you need to add water so that the rice is level with the tomato mixture/chicken stock go ahead and do so.</li>
<li>Add the bay leaves, cover the pot, and cook on medium to low heat for 15-30&nbsp;minutes.</li>
<li>When the liquid has almost dried up, add the remaining tomato stew, cover, and let it cook for another 5-10&nbsp;minutes on low heat until the liquid has completely dried up.</li>
<li>Turn off the heat, mix thoroughly, and your jollof rice is ready to be eaten!</li>
   </ol>
<ul><li>Jollof rice can be eaten alone or typically with any type of meat, egg, plantain, moimoi, salad, etc. If you have trust issues, serve with stew.</ul></ul>
