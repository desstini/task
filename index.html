    <!--<h1 style="font-size: 18px"> First Session </h1> -->

     <p class= First_Session> My name is <b>Destiny Otoibhi,</b> and my love for technology spurs from the fact that <i>technology has enabled globalisation on a larger scale.
        The increased interconnectedness and interdependence of people and countries  has been transformed by technology -from communication, to marketing,
        to customer satisfaction and many others. </i>The way the world does business, and even the way it views finance/financial structure has been changed/shaped by technology.
        Tech is very widespread and can be found in all sectors of the world.

     <p class="Second_Session"> So far, I have learnt about <b>git and github, html and CSS.</b> While HTML gives a webpage its structure, <b>CSS</b> <i>controls all design-related aspect of the website and hence,
        helps to create a great user experience, making websites more pleasing to the eyes.</i> 
     </p>

      <!--<h3 style="font-size: 18px"> Third Section</h3> -->

      <p class="Third_Session">
        A <b>margin</b> is the <i>space around an element's border</i> while <b>padding</b> is the <i>space between an element's border and the element's content </i>ie the space surrounding the content area.
        <b>Border </b> refers to the <i>space between the padding and the margin.</i>
